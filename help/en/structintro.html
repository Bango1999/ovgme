OvGME works by copying (either by replacing or adding) Mod file tree into the game file 
tree. To be correctly accomplished, the Mod file tree must have a specific structure. 
Indeed, OvGME does not uses file database to know which modifications a Mod should apply 
to a game. The database, is the Mod file tree itself.<br>
<br>
For this reason, a Mod should mirror the exact file tree (folder hierarchies) already 
present in the game, so OvGME can deduct what files are to be replaced, added, and saved 
as backup.<br>
<br>
OvGME supports two Mod structure. The Directory-Mod, which is a simple directory, and 
the Mod-Archives, which is a zipped version of a Directory-Mod. The Mod-Archives 
structure allows some extra features such as Mod versioning and descriptions.
