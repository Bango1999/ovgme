<h4>I have two identical mod title in the mods list, one is Directory type, the other is Zip Archive type, why ?</h4>

OvGME identifies Mods by their name, the type is a secondary identification. So, 
if in the Mods stock folder there is a Directory-Mod (sub-folder) named 
"<i>My Mod v1.0</i>" <b>AND</b> a valid mod archive named "<i>My Mod v1.0.zip</i>", 
OvGME will see both as valid Mod to be installed. This is an ambiguous but not dangerous 
situation since you can't enable both versions: if you enable either one or the other, 
the duplicate Mod-Archive and Directory-Mod versions disappear to let only one 
Enabled version.

<h4>I have removed a Mod from the Mods stock folder, but it still in the list as Enabled ?</h4>
Fortunatly YES. Once a Mod is enabled (installed), the backup data is stored in a safe 
location and OvGME keeps a look to the available data to restore. So the Mod still 
visible in the list as an installed one and backup data sill available for restore. 
Once you disabled the Mod, if the Mod is no longer available in the Mod stock, it will 
disappear from the Mods list.

<h4>Where are stored backed files by default ?</h4>
If you don't have chosen a custom backup directory for the selected game, the backed 
game files are stored in a "<i>backups</i>" named sub-folder in the dedicated game 
sub-folders within the OvGME application home directory indicated by your system, 
usually: "<i>ProgramData\OvGME\&lt;game Sub-folder&gt;\backups</i>".
