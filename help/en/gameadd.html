    To manage mods for a game, you have to add a game in the OvGME
    management list. To add a game you can click on the "<b>Add Game</b>"
    button or go to the "<b>Game</b>" menu then select "<b>Add...</b>".
    The proper dialog will prompts you to specify informations about game
    configuration to add. 
    
    <blockquote> 
      <b>Game Title</b><br>
      This is the main identifier for game management entry. This title
      can be what you want and can be modified later.<br><br>
      <b>Game Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to the root installation folder of the game
      you want to manage. OvGME will use this path to identify the game
      and build file tree to apply mods and create backup data for this
      game. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Mods Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to an existing mods stock folder where OvGME
      will look to gather available mods for this game.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use custom backup folder</b><br>
      You can choose a custom backup folder. This folder will contain
      all the backup files for the game.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Back Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to an existing folder where OvGME will save
      original game files.<br>
    </blockquote>
    
    To activate a game you just have to select the desired entry in the
    game management list combo box. Once you activated a game, the
    configured mods stock folder is analyzed to gather the available
    mods, also the backup data are checked to show you the mods you can
    disable.
