    To manage and install Mods for a game, a software or a destination 
    folder, you have to add a config in the OvGME management list. To 
    create a new configuration you can click on the "<b>New Config</b>" 
    button or go to the "<b>Config</b>" menu then select "<b>New...</b>". 
    A new dialog window will prompts you to specify informations about 
    the new  configuration to create. 
    
    <blockquote> 
      <b>Config Title</b><br>
      This is the main identifier for management list entry. This title
      can be what you want and can be modified later.<br><br>
      <b>Root Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to the root destination folder.
      This is usually the game or software installation folder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mods Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to an existing Mods stock folder, this is 
      where OvGME will seek for available Mods for this configuration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use custom backup folder</b><br>
      You can choose a custom backup folder instead of the default
      OvGME backup location.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Back Path</b><br>
      This must be the path to an existing folder, this folder will
      contain backup file tree for this configuration.<br>
    </blockquote>
    
    To activate a configuration you just have to select the desired 
    entry in the management list combo box. Once you activated a 
    configuration, the Mods stock folder and backup folder are analyzed 
    to gather available Mods for installation or restoration.
