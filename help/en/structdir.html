    <table bgcolor="#000" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="color:#fff; font-size:14pt;">

    <br>
A Directory-Mod must be a folder which contain the file tree with sub-folders that 
mirror the game's files and sub-folders hierarchy. This folder must be placed in the 
Mods stock folder, OvGME will take it as the Mod root directory.<br> 
<br> 
Obviously, a Directory-Mod does not have to include all file tree, folders and 
sub-folder of the targeted game. Only the needed ones to respect the game file tree 
comparison between already existing files and modified files should be added. However, 
a Mod can also include files or folders that does not already exists in the game file 
tree, they will be added as new files or folders (then deleted once the Mod is disabled) 
in the game file tree.<br> 
<br>
For example, if the game file tree is the following:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c1; MyGame<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Landscape<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
</span>
</blockquote>
And if your Mod consist of changing some .dds texture files in 
"<i>MyGame\Textures\Vehicles</i>" your Directory-Mod folder should be structured as 
follow:
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c1; My Texture Mod<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
</span>
</blockquote>
Then, the "My Texture Mod" folder must be copier in the Mods stock folder of 
this game te be recognized as a valid Directory-Mod.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: The Directory-Mod root folder should not contain files that are not intented to be
copied into the game file tree, such as readme.txt file or any other extra file, since
OvGME will considering them as part of the Mod, then, copying them into the game
file tree.</i>
