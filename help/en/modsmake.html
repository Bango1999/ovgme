OvGME provides a tool to create a valid Mod-Archive (zip) from an existing 
Directory-Mod. The Directory-Mod have to be already well structured according the 
compatible mod structure described into the Mod structure chapter.<br> 

<h4>From main menu</h4>
Go to the "<b>Mods</b>" menu then select 
"<b>Make Mod-Archive...</b>". The proper dialog will appear.<br>
<br> 

<h4>From Quick Pop-Up</h4>
Select a Directory-Mod you want to convert into Mod-Archive in the
Mod list, then click on mouse right button. In the pop-up menu, select 
"<b>Make Mod-Archive...</b>".<br>

<blockquote>
<b>Directory-Mod</b><br> 
This must be the path to the Directory-Mod folder to add to zip archive. This folder must be the one that contain the game file tree mirror with modified files.<br>
<br> 
<b>Destination</b><br> 
This the path to folder where the mod archive will be created.<br>
<br> 
<b>Version</b><br> 
This is the version of the Mod to be defined for this release. This value is used by the repositories. The version string will be added as version.txt file in the root of the Mod-Archive.<br> <br> 
<b>Description</b><br> 
This is the optional description for the mod. If the description is not empty, a proper .txt file will be added in the root of the Mod-Archive, this .txt file will be automatically recognized as mod description by OvGME.<br>
<br> 
<b>Compression level</b><br>

<br> 
</blockquote>

Once you entered the proper values, you can click on the "<b>Make</b>" button to begin
the creation process. The creation process can be canceled at any time.<br><br>  

<i>Note: If your Mod contain many heavy files, this process can take awhile
since it compress all files in zip format (best compression method).</i>
