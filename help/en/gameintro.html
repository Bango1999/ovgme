OvGME allow to manage Mods for several games, software or other custom 
destinations through the main instance. A configuration entry defines 
the parameters for one working directory. A configuration works with 
three components: The destination root, the Mods stock folder, and 
the backup folder.<br> 
<br>
<h4>Destination root folder</h4>
The destination root (Root path), is where OvGME will install Mods
when you enable them. This can be a game or software installation folder, 
or any other folder where you want Mods to apply some changes.<br>
<br>
<h4>Mods stock folder</h4>
The Mods stock folder is where OvGME will seek for available Mods. This
is where you must store your Mods for this destination root folder 
(i.e. game, software, etc. )<br>
<br>
<h4>Backup folder</h4>
The Backup folder is where OvGME will keeps all original files of 
a destination root folder (i.e. game, software, etc. ) which are 
modified by installed Mods. By default, OvGME keeps backups data in
its own internal structure (ProgramData\OvGME), but a custom backup 
folder can be choosen for each configuration.<br>
<br>

<i>Note: Each configuration destination root must be unique, 
you cannot create several configuration for the same destination root.</i>
