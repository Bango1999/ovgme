You can edit configuration for the current selected game. To edit current game configuration go 
the "<b>Game</b>" menu then select "<b>Edit current...</b>". 
The proper dialog will appear.<br>
<br>

<blockquote> 
<b>Game Title</b><br>
This is the main identifier for game management entry. This title can be what you want.<br>
<br>
<b>Mods Path</b><br>
This must be the path to an existing mods stock folder where OvGME will look to gather 
available mods for this game.<br>
<br>
<b>Use custom backup folder</b><br>
You can choose a custom backup folder. This folder will contain all the backup files for 
the game.<br>
<br>
<b>Back Path</b><br>
This must be the path to an existing folder where OvGME will save original game files.<br>
<br>
</blockquote> 

<i>Note: You cannot change the game root folder path for an existing game management entry, since 
the game root path must be unique (to prevent mod and backup overlaps, you cannot create 
several game management entry for the same game) and is the main game configuration 
identifier. If you created a game with the wrong root folder path, you must delete the 
entry then create a new one.</i>
